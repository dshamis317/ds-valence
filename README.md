# App Name: Valence


## Research/Concept

Valence is a way for people to discover new music, make playlist of their favorite songs and see their music in a new way. We all love our music but we don't have a good way of understaing what makes up a song: what makes it unique and what makes it appeal to us.

Valence is an interactive tool that allows anyone to visualize their music and see the story of their own musical taste.
